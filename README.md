This repository contains an implementation of a user-defined string class in C++ that closely mimics the functionality of the built-in std::string. The custom string class provides core string manipulation operations such as concatenation, comparison, indexing, and more, making it an excellent project for understanding object-oriented programming and memory management in C++.

Features

Dynamic Memory Management: The string class uses dynamic memory allocation to store and manage character arrays.

Basic String Operations: String concatenation (+, +=) Character access (indexing with []) String comparison (==, !=, <, >) Copy constructor and assignment operator Substring operations Capacity Management: Manage string capacity and resizing when needed. Destructor: Proper memory cleanup to avoid memory leaks.

Additional Utility Functions:

length(): Return the length of the string. empty(): Check if the string is empty. clear(): Clear the contents of the string.
